# How to Play
## Start with the First Word
The game begins with a random word. Your goal is to build a chain of words by following the rules!

## Follow the Chain
Type a word that starts with the last letter of the previous word. Example: If the word is **"Banana"**, the next word must start with **"A"**, like **"Apple"**.

## Act Fast!
You have a limited amount of time to type the next word. Be quick to keep the chain alive!

##Score Points
**+10 points** for each valid word.
**-5 points** for invalid words
**-15 points** for using a word previously used.

## Combos and Bonuses
Earn extra points by using rare letters like **Q**, **Z**, and **X**. Build combos by entering multiple correct words quickly. The longer the word, the more points you score!
## The Goal
Keep the word chain alive by typing words that follow the rules. Test your speed, vocabulary, and focus!
